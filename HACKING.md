# Developing for font-emoticons

For developing tips, see:

<https://github.com/skrysmanski/blogtext/blob/master/HACKING.md>

Font emoticons are created by:

For which icons were selected, see "selected-icons.png".

## Troubleshooting

* If some emoticons are not converted, check if they're being masked accidentally (by commenting out the unmasking code line).

## Manual Test: All Emoticons (Post Text)

*Note:* Use the classic editor for pasting this content. I could not figure out how to get this done in the Gutenberg editor.
